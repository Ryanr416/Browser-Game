In order to start the game, you will have to click a letter on the available keyboard. A category is available at the top left corner to give you an idea 
of what you may be spelling . 






My future plans include : Adding multiple categories, Adding pictures that look more alike, Adding a favicon image, Adding a more detailed "Lives Left" title.
